## Jonah Kaplan

I'm a Data Scientist based out of San Francisco with a deep interest in computer vision and all things tech. I made this site to highlight my projects I worked on as I've taught myself computer vision. I've also included other, non CV, projects just for kicks.


### Computer Vision Self-Teaching
My introduction to computer vision began by following the [PyImageSearch guide](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/start-here/). I've also spent time digging into resources supplied by Pytorch and FastAI. Overall, I've studied and have a working knowledge of:
- Keras, TF, PyTorch
- Object Detection
- Image Classification
- CV Face Applications
- Deep Learning for CV

### See some sweet content

- [COVID-19 Mask Usage Classifier](pages/mask_cv.md): Trained and deployed binary classification model on neighborhood activity to understand the prevelance of mask wearing throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. 
- [Kaggle Project: Quivk CV Model Evaluation](https://www.kaggle.com/jonahikaplan/pytorch-quick-experimentation-framework): I wanted to further develop my PyTorch skills and do some quick evaluation on how configurations affect our model performance.
- [Album Cover Mosaic Generator](pages/image_mosaic.md): R project which generates album cover mosiacs off of your music taste.
- [Real ID Helper](pages/real_id.md): GCP trained image classifier to identify license compliance with Real ID regulation.
- [Music Information Retreival Visualization](pages/mir.md): Utilized machine learning [MIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_information_retrieval) tools ([Librosa](https://librosa.github.io/librosa/), [Spleeter](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter), Scikitlearn, Spotify API), LED's, and an arduino to auto generate music light shows.
